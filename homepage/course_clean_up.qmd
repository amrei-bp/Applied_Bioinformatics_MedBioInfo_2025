<br>
Now you have time to finish up some of the things you did not have time for during the course. 

- Is there another post you would like to write?
- Some Quarto thing you saw in our material/ in a fellow students homepage you'd like to try out?
- A tool you'd like to test with Pixi?

Once you are finished, please fill in the end-of-course feedback questionnaire, and send me the URL of your blog and GitHub repository (via Canvas). 

Thanks for attending this course, I am looking forward to your feedback!
