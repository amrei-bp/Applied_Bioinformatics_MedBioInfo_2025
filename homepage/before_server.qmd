title: "Connect to the server"
---

<br>
For this course, we will be working on a remote server, HPC2N. You should already have applied for a user account there. If you haven't, [do it now](before_accounts.qmd).

Here, you will access the server for the first time. **You will need a terminal, your user name and the temporary password you will have gotten from HPC2N.**

::: {.callout-important}
If you have forgotten your password, or it's no longer valid, you can re-set it using the [Password reset service](https://docs.hpc2n.umu.se/documentation/password/).

## IF NEEDED: Get a working Linux terminal on Windows 

For the sake of simplicity we will teach you the way to use tools on Linux subsystems only. Hence, **if you have a Windows PC or laptop** you need to set up a way to access a Linux terminal. You can find plenty of [tutorials](https://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/#:~:text=Assuming%20you%20have%2064%2Dbit,t%20work%20until%20you%20reboot.) online to do this, but here are some steps that should be easy enough to follow:

- type in the bottom left search bar "powershell", right-click on the result and select "run as administrator"
- copy-paste in the window you opened the following command:

```{.bash}
wsl --install
```

- reboot your system
- open the Microsoft store and search for Ubuntu
- install Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS
- launch it, set a username and a password

## Access server via VScode

We can use VScode to connect to the server. For this, we need to install the `remote SSH` extension from within VScode. 

::: {.callout-tip}
In the side bar, click on the extensions symbol (looks like building blocks), and search for `remote SSH`. Click then on install in the lower right corner. 
:::

### add new SSH host

- Open the Command Palette (View -> Command Palette).
- Type `Remote-SSH` and select `Remote-SSH: Add New SSH Host`.
- Type `ssh username@kebnekaise.hpc2n.umu.se`, where you substitute "username" with your HPC2N user name. 
- If VScode cannot automatically detect the trype of server you need to select `Linux`. 
- You will be asked to pick a SSH configuration file to update. Choose the default (top of the list `.ssh/config`). 

### connect to server

- Type `Remote-SSH` and select `Remote-SSH: Connect to Host`.
- Select the HPC2N server.
- type in your password.

After a bit of setting up you will see in the bottom left corner the verification that you are connected to the server:

## After the first log-in: reset password

In the welcome mail you got when your HPC2N account was created there was a link to create a first, temporary password. When you have logged in using that, you need to change your password.

From the [HPC2N documentation](https://docs.hpc2n.umu.se/documentation/access/#first__time__login__password__change): 

This is done using the passwd command:

```{.bash}
passwd
```

Use a good password that combines letters of different case. Do not use dictionary words. Avoid using the same password that you also use in other places.

- It will first ask for your current password. The first time you login, that will be the temporary password you created with the HPC2N password reset service.
- Type in that and press enter.
- Then type in the new password you want, enter, and repeat.
- You have changed the password.

You are now on connected to the login node of the cluster.

Open up the terminal in VScode (View -> Terminal), 
and you are ready for the next chapter, learning (or repeating) the basics of the command line.
