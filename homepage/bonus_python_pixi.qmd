title: "Using Python in Pixi"

<br> 
You can also install Python packages into your Pixi environment. As an example we will use [FastQE](https://pypi.org/project/fastqe/), a Python based tool that translates the fastq quality scores into emojis. 

## Prepare the environment

```{.bash}
pixi init fastqe -c conda-forge
cd fastqe/
pixi add python
pixi add --pypi fastqe
pixi add --pypi setuptools
```

## run FastQE on your sample(s)

```{.bash}
pixi run srun -A project_ID -t 02:00 fastqe --html  --output sample_name.html ../sample1.fastq
```
