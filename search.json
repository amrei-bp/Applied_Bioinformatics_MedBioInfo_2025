I will showcase the use of environments, containers, and established pipelines so that you can run these analyses on any operating system, as well as on systems that are not high performance computing clusters. And first and foremost: these tools and techniques can be used regardless of which type of bioinformatics you are ultimately working with.\nThe website will remain active after the course so that you have access to the material even after the course.\nWe will meet in person in Ultuna between Monday, October 6th, and Friday, October 10th, 2025. However, to get the most out of this course, we expect you to do some preparation in advance. This is to set-up and get aquainted with some of the tools we will be using.\nYou will not be able to participate properly without completing the pre-course material! If possible start today and do a bit every day.\nI want to thank Lizel Potgieter for her valuable contributions to the materials for this course!\n\nBefore the course\n\n\nTopic\nContent\n\n\n\n\nVScode\nSettting up and getting aquainted with VScode",

Here is my starting screen: \nYours will look slightly different, especially in the activity bar all the way on the left, because I have already installed extensions when working with VScode. So don’t worry about the exact look.\nTo get aquainted with some of the features of VScode, please watch this 7-minute video from the Visual Studio homepage. Follow along the tutorial (as far as you can, he’s not providing the last script he’s showcasing).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you can’t see the terminal on the lower part of the screen, you can open it by clicking on the button on the upper right of the screen.\n\n\n\nClick here to open the terminal",
